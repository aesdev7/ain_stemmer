This is on Form & Meaning.
Speech-forms could be scientifically defined only if all branches of science, especially, psychology and
Physiology were close to perfection. Meanwhile, we have to rest upon fundamental Phonological assumptions of linguistics; such as, in every speech-community some utterances are alike in form and meaning. Hence, the following questions:
Q. Can we recognize the distinctive features of an utterance by a purely phonetic observations\plane? (without knowing the meaning ahead; vowels melody & intercalation, for example). 
Q. What features of sound count as “significant” for the purposes of communication?

This is to generate all possible bigrams, trigrams and quadgrams of classical Arabic twenty eight phonetic alphabet symbols in-a pre-morphological structure. Specifically, to generate bigrams, we will:
-	Multiply the consonants alphabet 28X28 which will result in 784. ( pre-binyan state)
-	Bigraming (pairing) the resultants will result in 392 binyanim ...
